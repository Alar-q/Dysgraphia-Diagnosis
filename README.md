# DysgraphiaRMAT

Application of image processing and deep learning technologies for the diagnosis of dysgraphia.

Research Methods and Tools.

A collected database of a Slovak manuscript from a group of school-aged children was used. Data collected from Wacom tablets were converted into digital images. Computer Vision and Deep Learning methods were used to process, analyse images and detect dysgraphia. 

A web application was developed as an interface to upload images and get a diagnosis from our classification model.

Good results were obtained. Future research may include data collection with Cyrillic writing: Russian, Kazakh.
